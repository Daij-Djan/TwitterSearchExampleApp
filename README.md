TwitterSeachExampleApp
======================

A sample IOS App that can search twitter -- for edu purposes, not production ready :D

- it loads user profile icons (async, cached)
- it has custom cells that resize on click
- it shows results paginated (the tableview has a load moreâ€¦ option while more is available on twitter.com)
- it keeps a search history which is shown under UISearchBar

*it's tested on iphone 4s with ios 6. xcode 4.6 was used*
